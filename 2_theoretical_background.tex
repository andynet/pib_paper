\chapter{Theoretical background}
\label{chap:background}

In this chapter we will present theory behind the methods used in the project. 
Namely, we will present principal component analysis and feed forward neural networks.

\section{Principal component analysis}
Principal component analysis (PCA) is method commonly used for dimension reduction.

\section{Feed forward neural networks}
Feed forward neural networks are the main method explored in this work.
In this section we will describe all of the basic parts of neural networks in greater detail.
