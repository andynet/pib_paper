Cancer is a collection of related diseases.
In all types of cancer the cells start to reproduce uncontrollably and spread into surrounding tissue.
These uncontrolled cells may form growths called tumors, which are masses of tissue.

The goal of this work will be to build a neural network for classifying of tumorous tissue.
Neural networks are highly versatile models able to capture non-linear relationships between many predictors.
Since the rediscovery of neural networks and the means of their training, these models became widely used in many applications and they proved themselves to be of high accuracy even for complex problems.

In this project we would like to use neural networks for two main tasks.
First, predicting the primary site of a tumorous tissue.
The solution to this problem might be especially useful in metastatic cancer, where the clinicians can find a tumorous cells all around the body of a patient.
Since there are multiple therapies to help with different types of cancer, it is of high importance to know the primary site of the tissue, to establish the most efficient treatment.

The second objective would be to identify the stage of the cancer.
This could tell us something more about the severenity of the illness and could potentially also help to choose better suited cure.

We divided our work to three main parts.
Firstly, chapter Materials and Methods where we will describe data available for the analysis together with the source databases. 
In this chapter we will also describe each step of our pipeline and reasons for doing that step.
In the next chapter, we will present the results and provide visualisations of the most important findings.
Furthermore, we will discuss advantages and drawbacks of selected methods and also try to formulate the improvements for the future work.
