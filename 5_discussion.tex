\chapter{Discussion}
In this chapter we will discuss what the results suggest about the problems which we were solving.
We will also discuss some possible improvements in the future.
Lastly, we will evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of the methods used in this project.

\section{Predicting tissue type}
As we could see tissue type prediction from the expression data seems to be relatively easy problem.
We noticed that the best pefforming model was the model without any hidden layer.
Since this model can be reduced to simple linear model, this suggest that the relationship between the gene expression and tissue type is also strongly linear.
This leads us to the conclussion that the neural networks are not ideal for this type of problem, because we are not able to fully use their power.
Since the linear relationship, it is probable that the simpler, more interpretable model could have been built for this problem.

\section{Predicting stage of the cancer}
This problem seemed to be much harder than the tissue type prediction.
The results were reflecting it.
Although we were able to improve our predictions in comparisson with the null model, the accuracy was much below the usability.
The possible improvements over our work could include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item increasing the sample size
    \item treating stage as ordered variable
    \item treating stage as continuous variable
    \item including tissue type as a predictor
\end{enumerate} 

\section{Pathways layer}
Pathways layer did not show to be improvement over simple linear layer.
