The goal of this project was to predict cancer type from RNA-seq data using neural networks.
We were successfully able to predict tissue type with high accuracy.
The prediction was achieved by neural networks using PyTorch library.
After realizing the relative simplicity of the first problem, we tried to tackle the harder problem of predicting cancer stage. 
The prediction for this problem was less successful than for the tissue type. 
Even though we build a model with better accuracy than the null model, the accuracy of this model is probably not high enough to be practically useful.

The learning goals of this projects were to learn about the parts of the feedforward neural network and to implement neural networks in PyTorch library.
We have met this goal in its full extent with additional experience of designing custom layers for neural networks.
