The goal of this project was to predict cancer type from RNA-seq data using neural networks.
We were successfully able to predict tissue type with high accuracy.
This was achieved by neural networks using PyTorch library.
After realizing relative simplicity of the first problem, we tried to tackle harder problem of predicting cancer stage. 
This was less successfull. 
Even though we build a model with better accuracy than null model, the accuracy of this model is probably not high enough to be practically useful.

The learning goals of this projects were to learn about the parts of feedforward neural network and to implement neural networks in PyTorch library.
This goal was met in its full extent with additional experience of designing own layers for neural networks.

We also performed multiple experiments assessing the quality of the created models.
