\chapter{Materials and methods}
In this chapter we will describe the steps of work performed in this project.
We will start with presentation of data which were available to us and which we used.
Then we will describe how we processed them to the form suitable as input for our neural network.
Finally we will show how we designed our neural network in detail and how we tested the performance of our designs.
